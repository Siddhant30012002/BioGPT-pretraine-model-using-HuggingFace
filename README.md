# BioGPT-based Drug Information Generator using Transformer

This project uses Microsoftâ€™s pre-trained BioGPT model, available on Hugging Face, to provide information about drugs. The model generates text about a given drug's use case by using a natural language processing (NLP) approach. The application is built using Streamlit, where users can input the name of a drug to get its usage details.

## Features
- Text generation for drug usage information.
- Interactive form to input drug names.
- Uses BioGPT pre-trained model for context-based responses.
- Provides real-time responses through Streamlit.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The core programming language for this project.
- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the interactive web interface.
- **Hugging Face's Transformers**: For leveraging BioGPT's pre-trained model.
